### Bit Manipulation
* Algorithmically manipulate bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte.
### Bitwise Operators
* Works on bits and performs bit by bit operator
* & - Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both
operands
* | - Binary OR Opeartor copies a bit if it exists in either operand
* ^ - Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand
but not both.
* ~ - Binary Ones Compliment Operator is unary and has the effect of flipping
bits.
* << - BInary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the
number of bits specified by the right operand.
* >> - Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by
the number of bits specified by the right operand.
