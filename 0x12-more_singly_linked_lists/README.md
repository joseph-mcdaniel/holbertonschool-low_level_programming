### Singly linked lists
#### Description:
*A linked list a linear, dynamic data structure where each element is a separate
object.
#### Linked lists vs arrays
*One disadvantage of using arrays to store data is that arrays are static
structures and therefore cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the
data set.
*One disadvantage of a linked list vs an array is that id does not allow direct
access to the individual elements. If you want to access a particular item
then you have to start at the head and follow the references.
* Another disadvantage of linked lists vs array is that it uses more memory.
